# Utilities

Implement several functions and libraries used by other components, like:

- di_utilities.py: It is specific for Brazilian interest rate market. Calculate working days, recover settlements prices from the BVMF website and so on.
- eda.py: Several functions to help visualize the results. May have functions that do not work anymore.
- microstruct_stats.py: Implement a structure to hold information about microstructure data. Use classes from `utils.py`.
